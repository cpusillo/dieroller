# dieroller
Meant to be a simple web app for rolling several commonly used polyhedral dice.
I didn't like what I saw when I googled die-rolling applications so I made my own.

### How to use this app:
Click each button to roll a die.

Click "Roll All" from top menu to roll all dice at once.
Click "Reset" from top menu to clear all selections.

### dieroller 2.0!
I am working on the 2.0 version of this app, here's a wireframe:
